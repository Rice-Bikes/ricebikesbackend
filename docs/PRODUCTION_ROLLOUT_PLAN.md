# Production Rollout Plan: Prisma to Drizzle ORM Migration

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for rolling out the Drizzle ORM migration to production. We have completed all implementation work, including repository implementations, factory patterns, service layer integration, and testing. This rollout plan focuses on safely deploying these changes to production with minimal risk and disruption.

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected during any phase, follow these rollback procedures:

### Individual Repository Rollback

1. Disable the specific feature flag for the problematic repository:
   ```
   await updateFeatureFlag('drizzle_repo_name', false, 'admin', 'Rollback due to [issue description]');
   ```

2. Clear the feature flag cache:
   ```
   clearFeatureFlagCache();
   ```

3. Monitor system to confirm the rollback resolved the issue

4. Investigate root cause in staging environment

### Complete Rollback

If multiple repositories show issues or there's a systemic problem:

1. Disable the global Drizzle flag:
   ```
   await updateFeatureFlag('use_drizzle', false, 'admin', 'Complete rollback due to [issue description]');
   ```

2. Disable all individual repository flags:
   ```
   await updateFeatureFlag('drizzle_user_repo', false, 'admin', 'Complete rollback');
   await updateFeatureFlag('drizzle_customer_repo', false, 'admin', 'Complete rollback');
   // etc. for all repositories
   ```

3. Clear all feature flag caches:
   ```
   clearFeatureFlagCache();
   ```

4. Set environment variable (if used):
   ```
   USE_DRIZZLE=false
   ```

5. Restart the application to ensure all repositories revert to Prisma

## Monitoring Guide

During each phase of the rollout, closely monitor the following metrics:

### Performance Metrics
- **Response times** for key API endpoints
- **Database query execution times**
- **Memory usage** patterns
- **CPU utilization**

### Error Metrics
- **Error rates** for API endpoints
- **Database connection errors**
- **Stack traces** related to ORM operations
- **Client-side errors** that might indicate API issues

### Business Metrics
- **Transaction success rates**
- **Order fulfillment times**
- **Customer operation success rates**
- **Inventory accuracy**

## Success Criteria

The rollout will be considered successful when:

1. All repositories are using Drizzle implementations in production
2. Performance metrics are equal to or better than with Prisma
3. No increase in error rates is observed
4. All critical business operations function correctly
5. Database operations are stable and performant

## Conclusion

This rollout plan provides a conservative, phased approach to migrate from Prisma to Drizzle ORM in production. By deploying one repository at a time and using feature flags for granular control, we can minimize risk and quickly address any issues that arise. The monitoring plan ensures we have visibility into system behavior throughout the process.

After successful completion, we'll have a more performant, type-safe, and maintainable ORM solution powering our application.
